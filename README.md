## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains research-based guidelines and best practices for effectively integrating generative AI tools into programming education. The guide addresses both the opportunities and risks of using AI assistants like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and other Large Language Models (LLMs) in the learning process using examples of the C programming language.

## 📚 Background

The increasing adoption of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally changing the learning process in higher education and presenting traditional teaching methods with new challenges. Particularly when learning a new programming language, AI-supported tools open up a variety of new possibilities to support students in their learning process.

### Key Areas Covered:

- **AI-Assisted Code Generation**: How to use tools like GitHub Copilot effectively
- **Intelligent Debugging**: Leveraging AI for error detection and resolution
- **Concept Explanation**: Using chatbots and LLMs for learning programming concepts
- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for programming tasks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoiding over-dependence and maintaining critical thinking skills

## 🚀 Why This Guide Matters

### Opportunities of AI in Programming Education:
- **Code Generation**: Support in generating code snippets and functions
- **Debugging Assistance**: Faster error diagnosis and solution suggestions  
- **Personalized Learning**: Adaptation of content to individual needs
- **Concept Clarification**: Step-by-step explanations for complex programming problems

### Risks to Address:
- **Copy-Paste Without Understanding**: Students may copy AI-generated code without comprehending the underlying concepts
- **Over-Dependence on AI**: Excessive reliance on AI systems could negatively impact independent problem-solving abilities
- **Critical Thinking Erosion**: Unreflective use may lead to neglect of fundamental algorithmic thinking skills

## 📖 Content Structure

The guide is structured as an academic paper following IEEE format and includes:

1. **Introduction to AI in Education**
2. **Types of AI Models and Their Applications**
3. **Large Language Models (LLMs) as Foundation of Modern Chatbots**
4. **Use Cases for Generative AI in Programming Context**
5. **Prompt Engineering Techniques**
6. **Best Practices and Guidelines**
7. **Empirical Evaluation Framework**
